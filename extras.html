	<h1>Welcome to my website😂😂</h1>
	<p>This is my new website...thought I'd change it 'cause the other one was just too slow🤷‍♂️.</p>
	<p>This new one introduces a new UI focused on minimal design🔥🔥. It's created with the base of my own CSS library <a href="/projects/minymal">Minymal css</a></p>

	Since beginning my journey as a freelance designer nearly 6 months ago, 
	I've done some private works and some remote works for some companies, 
	consulted for startups, and collaborated with talented people to create digital products for both business and consumer use. 
	I'm quietly confident, naturally curious, and perpetually improving my chops.
